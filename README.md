This app helped me to understand and learn more about the SwiftUI framework nad also to get used to Swift 5 I started to learn to abut it and at the same time, I build this app for my Apple Watch after noticed the app was completed in just a few days I decided to publish to apple store. 
Feel free to use it and create a new version.
